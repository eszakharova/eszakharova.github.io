    <p>Dear Organizers,</p></div>
<div>
<p>As an NLP enthusiast, I'm extremely interested in attending Yandex NLP week.</p>
    <p>I've got my bachelor's degree in 2018 majoring in Fundamental and Computational Linguistics.
        The following relevant disciplines were on my curriculum: Python programming, natural language processing,
        applied machine learning, linear algebra and mathematical analysis, probability theory and mathematical
        statistics. I am currently working as Python developer. My duties include development and implementation
        of ML models, I also had experience using them for NLP tasks. Thus I believe to meet the prerequisites
        of the course. </p>
    <p>I want to continue professional development in the domain of natural language processing. Attending this event
        would help me to deepen current knowledge, adopt advanced techniques and become a better specialist. </p>
    <p>Besides the industry side, I am even more interested in the research side of the upcoming lectures.
        I'm planning on going back to academic research and proceeding to a master's degree in the field of computational
        linguistics. Yandex NLP week would allow me to figure out my research interests, learn about the cutting edge
        trends and technologies in natural language processing and draw new ideas for further exploration. </p></div>
